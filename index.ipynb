For some students, this section will be the most difficult as it introduces many new concepts at once, but you'll continue to practice these day after day, until they become second nature. For those of you with a strong background in computing, we recommend reviewing these lessons. It's never a bad idea to review the fundamentals. We've introduced additional challenges for students who are finding the labs easy, so look out for the \"Level Up (optional)\" section in some of the labs to get some deeper practice with Python and visualization."]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "source": []}], "metadata": {"hide_input": false, "kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3", "language": "python", "name": "python3"}, "language_info": {"codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "file_extension": ".py", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "name": "python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "version": "3.7.6"}, "toc": {"base_numbering": 1, "nav_menu": {}, "number_sections": false, "sideBar": true, "skip_h1_title": true, "title_cell": "Table of Contents", "title_sidebar": "Contents", "toc_cell": false, "toc_position": {}, "toc_section_display": true, "toc_window_display": false}, "varInspector": {"cols": {"lenName": 16, "lenType": 16, "lenVar": 40}, "kernels_config": {"python": {"delete_cmd_postfix": "", "delete_cmd_prefix": "del ", "library": "var_list.py", "varRefreshCmd": "print(var_dic_list())"}, "r": {"delete_cmd_postfix": ") ", "delete_cmd_prefix": "rm(", "library": "var_list.r", "varRefreshCmd": "cat(var_dic_list()) "}}, "types_to_exclude": ["module", "function", "builtin_function_or_method", "instance", "_Feature"], "window_display": false}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 2}
